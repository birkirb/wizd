  any setting in wizd.conf

Version 20 (20/05/2006) :

- Allow multiple aliases with the same name, and merge the directories for them

  files. It will look for tn_[foldername].jpg, [foldername].jpg, [foldername].gif, 
  [foldername]/Folder.jpg, [foldername]/AlbumArtSmall.jpg. If none are found, it 
  defaults to the standard icon.
